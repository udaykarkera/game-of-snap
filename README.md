'Game of Snap'  You have 1.5 hours (90 minutes) to write the card game of Snap. This is a test where you can show us your skills in OO.  Please stop when you reach this time, regardless of the state of completion and send the test back to me.  Here are the rules of the game: Two players are dealt the same number of cards from a shuffled deck. Each player takes it in turns to place their next card on a pile between them. If the two top cards on the pile match in numeric value (e.g. 9 == 9), the last player to place a card takes all the cards in the pile. The game continues until one player is out of cards.
